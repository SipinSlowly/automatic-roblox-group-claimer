# automatic-roblox-group-claimer
this uses the Roblox api to automate group ownership, this allows you to claim such group with only the ID.

usage:

to use this, open your browsers developer console, paste the script and replace "GroupID Here" with the un-claimed groups ID.

you now own the group, and you can not get terminated for this.

i can make a program that automatically claims the group for you, but i will not add that just yet. but for now, enjoy.
